# react-transclusion-tracking
A list of libraries that try to address the problem of transclusion in react. 

I am creating this list because there are meany of them and the community has not decided on a specific one at the moment of writing. There are many different approaches on the table and there isn't a single one that is being actively maintained. 
Additionally, the term "transclusion" was invented in the angular community not that long ago so there isn't even a consensus on how to name the thing.
